## 1.0.0 (2023-Apr-14) - Initial mod release

Features

* Movement
	* Platforms (Left/Right) - Press the grip button on your controller to create a floating platform in the air that you can stand on. There's a toggle for each hand so that you can disable one if it clashes with another mod's inputs.
	* Double Jump - Press the primary button (A) on your right controller in the air to get a boost in the direction you're looking.
	* Airplane - This allows the player to fly around. Spread your arms out like and airplane to activate and use your wrists to steer!
	* Speed - Significantly increases the player's movement speed
* Physics
	* Low Gravity - Decreases the strength of gravity
	* No Collide - Allows the player to fall through solid objects. Enabling this automatically enables platforms so you don't fall to your death!
* Teleportation
	* Checkpoint - Grip the left trigger to start summoning a holographic banana above your hand. Grip the right trigger to warp back to it.
	* Teleport - Make a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers and peer through it to initiate a teleport. Use your head to aim more finely.
* Interactions
	* Boxing - Better known as "punch mod", this allows the player to be punched around by others in the lobby. You can't be punched while touching the ground.
	* Piggyback - Allows you to ride other players! To mount someone, have them give you two-thumbs-up, and then grip their shoulder. If they give you two thumbs down at any point, you'll stop riding them. Consent is important!
	* X-Ray - Allows you to see other players through walls.
